# Diabetes Predictor :
> Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning and UI built by PYWEBIO.


In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like *Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI*. We will perform all the steps from *Data gathering to Model deployment.* During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one. Then we create a web app using Flask which is a python micro framework.

## Pywebio: 
 PyWebIO provides a series of imperative functions to obtain user input and output on the browser, turning the browser into a ‚Äúrich text terminal‚Äù, and can be used to build simple web applications or browser-based GUI applications. Using PyWebIO, developers can write applications just like writing terminal scripts (interaction based on input and print), without the need to have knowledge of HTML and JS. PyWebIO can also be easily integrated into existing Web services. PyWebIO is very suitable for quickly building applications that do not require complex UI.

# How to run the project? :thinking:
**1).** Run all command manually
  - Clone github repository in your local system  `gh repo clone rohitpathak18/Diabetes-Prediction`
  - Move in spam-sms-detector repository  `cd diabetes=predictor`
  - Create new virtual python environment  `python3 -m venv venv`
  - Activate virtual python environment  `source venv/bin/activate`
  - Install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt  using  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Run FlaskApp file  `python app.py`
  - Go to your browser and type localhost:8080 in the address bar.
  - Hurray! That's it. <br>
